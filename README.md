# Project B CGRA :bird: :sunrise_over_mountains:
WebGL scene of a mountain featuring an animated bird which can be controlled by the user and pick up branches.


#### Grade: 19.6


### Description
WebGL scene built using WebCGF that contains:
* A terrain with elevations, created using a shader
* A castle
* A surrounding environment (skybox)
* A forest, composed by trees created with procedural generation
* A bird, animated and controlable by the user
* A bird nest
* Branches that can be picked up by the bird and dropped in the nest
* Eggs
* Lightnings, created with procedural generation

As an extra, it was developed a 2-player **minigame** that features 2 birds (1 for each player), each with its own nest filled with eggs. The objective is to steal the other player's eggs and drop in your own nest.

**Project specifications can be seen in 'project_b.pdf'**
